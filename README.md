## About:

**Steady Node** is a compact **two univers CRMX transmitter** that can be attached to the back of an **iPad**, with DMX ArtNet data passing through the **USB-C** port.                                                                             
There is also a second USB-C port to connect all kinds of peripherals, like  your favorite MIDI faders, to the iPad.  

It's compatible with all app that support ArtNet, such as Blackout, Luminair and others as it creat a local ethernet network.


Although the project is still under development, it is currently functional, with prototypes already being tested on set.

You can already make it, flash it, and use it!

We hope it will soon be ready for commercial release. 

You can follow its open development here and even participate if you wish :)
