### **About:**
Dual-port ethernet Artnet nodes are somewhat expensive nowadays with simple [Pathport Duo's](https://stagedepot.co.uk/lighting/control-dimming/dmx-management/city-theatrical-pathport-c-series-node?sku=CT-P6202&gclid=CjwKCAjwuvmHBhAxEiwAWAYj-JbNi8wZCGz_KHbozcLFQ_qSdAPo95IHTKV8BdgGUl6DZUhPz_-OCBoC5V8QAvD_BwE) setting theatres back around Â£750. 
Based on our experience designing small-form-factor wireless DMX nodes, we took it upon ourselves to design a cheap and affordable wired ethernet node that would provide similar features to popular DMX nodes from established manufacturers such as ETC, City Theatrical and Chauvet DJ.  

### **Some demos:**
Before selling on Tindie, I have used our DMX nodes in many productions. Most recently, on a Cambridge Theatre Company production (Our House, The Madness Musical) in my local school's theatre [(Leys Great Hall)](https://www.theleys.net/591/venue-hire/great-hall) where we used one of our nodes to control our Cyc backdrop over the stage. It took us less than two minutes to have the node plugged into our ethernet switch and connected to our ETC Nomad console.

**Our ethernet nodes reduces latency, provides USB-C programmability, allows for one DMX input, two RDM compatible outputs and optional PoE support.

(please note that our DMX nodes are based on [mtongnz's dmx and rdm](https://github.com/mtongnz) library)
